Professor Pey Kin Leong
Associate Provost, Digital Learning

Professor Pey Kin Leong is Associate Provost for Digital Learning, the Kwan Im Thong Hood Cho Temple Chair Professor in Healthcare Engineering, and full professor of the Engineering Product Development (EPD) pillar at SUTD.

Kin Leong was appointed by the Ministry of Education (Singapore) as its founding Associate Provost to set up the SUTD undergraduate programme in 2010. With his pioneering effort, the design-centric undergraduate programme has been ranked as the “Top Emerging Leader in Engineering Education” in the MIT benchmarking study on the global state of the art in engineering education. Full ABET equivalent accreditation was awarded by the Engineering Accreditation Board, Institute of Engineers, Singapore (IES) in February 2017 for its engineering degree programmes. Similarly, the Master in Architecture degree programme was fully certified and recognised by Board of Architects Singapore in 2018. In January 2022, Kin Leong took on a new portfolio to work on a forward-looking cyber-phsycial campus initiative in the Office of Digital Learning.

Kin Leong received his Bachelor of Engineering (1989) and PhD (1994) in Electrical Engineering from the National University of Singapore. Previously, he held a Fellowship appointment in the Singapore-MIT Alliance and various research positions at the Institute of Microelectronics, Chartered Semiconductor Manufacturing, Agilent Technologies and National University of Singapore. Prior to joining SUTD, he was the Head of the Microelectronics Division, Director of the Nanyang NanoFabrication Center and Director of the Microelectronic Centre in the School of EEE at the Nanyang Technological University.

A senior member of IEEE and a Fellow of the ASEAN Academy of Engineering and Technology and IES, Kin Leong was the General Chair of IEEE IPFA2001 (Singapore) and the co-General Chair of IPFA2004 (Taiwan), the Chair of the Singapore IEEE joint REL/CPMT/EDS Chapter (2004 – 2005, 2009 & 2020 – 2021). He was also the Guest Editor of IEEE Transactions on Devices and Materials Reliability (2003 – 2005 & 2007), and has been an Editor since 2009.

Kin Leong has published more than 253 international refereed publications, 257 technical papers at international meetings/conferences, 6 book chapters and holds 40 US patents. In addition, he has delivered 7 keynote speeches and 76 invited talks. Kin Leong has contributed significantly to the CMOS gate dielectric reliability, specifically pioneering in the area of physical analysis for the study of ultra-thin dielectric breakdown mechanism. He was recognised by the IEEE International Integrated Reliability Workshop (IIRW) as one of the top 20 experts on Front‐End device reliability in 2018 and as a panellist of the Reliability Expert Forum (REF) on “Memory Technologies and Reliability” in 2019. He has graduated 35 PhD and more than 15 Master theses.

Kin Leong received the Singapore Public Administration Medal (Silver) at the National Day Awards in 2016 and serves on the Board of Governors, Temasek Polytechnic and the Design Education Advisory Committee, Singapore.
