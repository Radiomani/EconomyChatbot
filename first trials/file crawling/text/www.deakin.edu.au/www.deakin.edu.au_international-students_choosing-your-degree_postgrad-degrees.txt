Types of postgraduate degrees 





Masters by coursework
Deakin masters by coursework programs are typically 18 months to two years full time, or up to four years part time. Many degrees allow you to choose a ‘specialisation’ – the area of study from which you choose the majority of your units. Studies are completed mainly through coursework, with a thesis or major project completed in the last part of the degree.




Graduate certificates and graduate diplomas

Graduate certificates are usually one trimester in duration and are designed to add practical and vocational skills to your undergraduate degree, diploma or previous work experience. Graduate diplomas are usually two trimesters in duration. They are designed to build on the understanding and skills developed during a graduate certificate, or from work experience.







Masters by research
A Deakin masters by research program takes two years full time to complete, and can serve as a prerequisite to applying for PhD studies.For a masters by research degree, you will be allocated a dedicated research supervisor.




Doctoral programs (PhD)

Doctoral programs are between two and four years full time and are the highest degree available in academia. PhD students conduct original research in order to progress their chosen field. People choose to do PhDs if they want a career in academia or if they want to reach higher levels in their non-academic jobs.
