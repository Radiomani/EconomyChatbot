Prior to Establishment: Primary PeriodFrom 1992 to 2007
After EstablishmentFrom 2007 to 2009
After Establishment: Secondary Period2009 to Present




From 1992 to 2007
Prior to Establishment: Primary Period




 “The City of Ulsan Needs a National University.”




There were many obstacles that were overcome in order to make the dream of Ulsan citizens to come true. In 1992, the presidential candidate of South Korea, Young Sam Kim made a pledge of making a national university in Ulsan. In 1994, the committee for building a national university in Ulsan was organized with the name ‘Hanul University’ and started its activity.





“Ulsan City, Setting up University Establishment Planning Team”




The city of Ulsan has organized the university establishment planning team and committee and start activities of attracting by sending out establishment brochures to 702 organizations, such as universities, companies, and corporations. Despite these strenuous efforts, they did not raise the national interest, making the dream of establishing a national university sleeping away. 





Establishment of ‘Ulsan Citizen Organization of National University’




The citizens of Ulsan gathered to form an organization for the establishment of a national university in September, 2001 and this became the official organization, named the Ulsan Citizen Organization of National University in October 2001. This organization was composed of 160 organizations with around 2000 members.





Petition for Building a National University in Ulsan




On March 2002, the petition aiming for a million citizens was started. However, only 9 percent of the entire population of Ulsan partook for this event. In May 2003, once again, they held a pan-citizen meeting at Dongchun Sports Center in Ulsan for signature-gathering petitions. Despite being held on weekdays, 4000 citizens participated. After a year and a half, a total of 589 thousand of 106 thousand Ulsan citizens signed the petition, showing the will of building a National University in Ulsan.





Petition, Delivered to the Congress




In 2004, there was a relay speech for establishment of a National University. Including the ‘Ulsan Citizen Organization of National University’, 20 organizations all over Korea partook in this event, urging the e establishment of National University in Ulsan. In July of the same year, 33 members of the organization and 6 members of the assembly delivered the petition to the Congress.

Organization of the Council for Establishment of a National University at the Blue House




After there has been no progress on the establishment, the city of Ulsan announced the promotion of building a national university in Ulsan on August 2005, and in September of the same year, the council at the Blue House was organized. In this council, specifics of the university were discussed. Under the following conditions, a national university can be build in Ulsan: the number of applicants for entrance being 1500, benchmarking academic programs from MIT university, the city of Ulsan city will provide the land and the full financial support for constructing the University.

Announcement of Plans for the University Establishment




With the municipal assembly’s hard work, the plans for the university establishment were finally announced on September, 2005. On the same day, the City of Ulsan signed an agreement with the Ministry of Education and Human Resources Development of South Korea, regarding the University establishment. 









Selection of University Site




The city of Ulsan had organized the ‘Site selection committee’ in 2005 and had been accepting possible campus site candidates. The central and north districts of Ulsan, Ulju, and 10 other areas in Ulsan are selected as candidates. Decisions were made on February 2006 to select the Ulju area as the final site for building the University. Tensions between provinces could have occurred, but a common goal of making a national university in Ulsan made the entire province help each other.

Legislative Bill, Issued on the Establishment of a National University of Ulsan




At that time, the government decided to establish a legal basis upon the transition of a national university to a corporatized university over time in order to increase the competitiveness among national universities. However, due to severe protest from the national and public universities, the city of Ulsan decided that the only answer to solve this issue was to get an exclusive legislative push. The legislation was not issued by the government, but by the member of congress, and Ulju area congressmen Kang Gil Bu leaped head on into issuance of the legislation. 





First Presidential Appointment Ceremony




On September 2007, President Moo Je Cho was appointed as the first president of UNIST and the registration of the establishment of the University was also finished. With the support of the City of Ulsan, the First Presidential Inauguration of President Cho was held at UNIST on November, as well as the Groundbreaking Ceremony. The president revealed his intention towards making UNIST, a world leading university that is weighed alongside with KAIST and POSTECH.

UNIST Groundbreaking Ceremony










From 2007 to 2009
After Establishment
This is the period where the first president of UNIST, Moo Je Cho’s leadership and tactics came into play. President Cho stated “The quality of a University cannot overpass the quality of the professors, and great faculty also attracts outstanding students.” With this in mind, he personally went on a journey to recruit world-renowned scientists and also to attract outstanding students into UNIST by visiting various high schools in the world and organizing information sessions. 




Recruitment of World Class Faculty


President Cho believes that great faculty not only does great work, but also attracts outstanding students. With this in mind, he personally went on a journey to recruit world-renowned scientists in 2008 by visiting America’s outstanding universities, such as University of California Berkley, Stanford, Harvard, and Georgia Institute of Technology. Thanks to his efforts, 586 world-class scientists all over the world applied and 47 professors were recruited before the opening ceremony in 2009. The average age of professors is 38.6 years and this is the youngest age rate, compared to other national universities in Korea.

Globalized Education System


UNIST believes that ‘Convergence Technology focused University’, ‘Fostering Creative Intellects’, ‘Global University’ are the 3 key phrases of global education. With this vision in mind, UNIST benchmarked world-renowned universities, such as Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering in undergraduate aspects, MIT for graduate and research, and Georgia Institute of Technology for cooperative systems. Moreover, after the meeting with the President of HKUST, President Cho decided to conduct all academic courses in 100% English.

Recruitment of Outstanding Students



Summer Scenery, UNIST

UNIST was originally scheduled to open in 2010, but President Cho accelerated the plan to 2009. This brought several main problems, such as the admission of excellent students and completion of student dormitory. When student housing became a major issue, recruitment of outstanding students became even more difficult. The problem was solved by initially accommodating these students in professor’s apartment complexes and admitting only the half of the original entrance quota (500/1000) if the applicants did not meet their requirements or academic expectations. President Cho held many briefing sessions on its admission requirements for graduating high school students and their parents all around Korea. 






 Constructing state of the art research facilities



Fall Summer Scenery, UNIST

In order to have a world class faculty and an outstanding supporting staff, UNIST needed state-of-the-art research facilities. President Cho visited National Assembly to ask for financial support, and as a result we were able to receive government expenditure of 31 billion (KRW) from the municipal members of the congress for research facility construction. The development funding from the congress was enough for the initial cost of construction, but the funding for future research facilities is still a big homework.







Support from the City of Ulsan, Ulju County, and the Local Enterprises in Ulsan  



Winter Scenery, UNIST

Ulsan city promised to provide the annual development funding of 10 billion (KRW) for the next 15 years to UNIST. In addition, the Ulju County also promised to provide the annual funding of 5 billion (KRW) for the next 10 years. The local enterprises, such as Kyungdong City Gas has promised to support the development funding of 5 billion (KRW) for two years. We could not have built this University alone without the lavish financial support from the local enterprises, the City of Ulsan, the Ulju county and its citizens. We greatly appreciate all your kind support.








2009 to Present
After Establishment: Secondary Period




New Beginning as the First Corporatized National University





First Entrance Ceremony

The University’s first entrance ceremony was held on March, 2009, along with the establishment ceremony at the ongoing construction site on campus. At the ceremony, 500 admitted first-year students vowed to build UNIST the ‘Pioneering global science and technology institute that contributes to humanity.’ All admitted first-year students were the top 5% students of Korea, and this helped UNIST to become one of the best universities nationally.
