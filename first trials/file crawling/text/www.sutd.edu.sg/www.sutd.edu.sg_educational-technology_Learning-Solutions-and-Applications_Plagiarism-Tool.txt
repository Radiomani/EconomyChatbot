Turnitin
Turnitin is an extension to eDimension (Blackboard) which detects plagiarism in students’ work. It can be accessed from the Assignment tool in eDimension. The originality check compares student papers to millions of online sources.
Turnitin is an excellent tool that saves time and resolves cases of suspected academic dishonesty. Instructors can easily identify any plagiarised text in assignments before grading papers.
Feedback Studio
The Turnitin Feedback Studio is designed to empower you with the tools needed for an efficient marking process.
