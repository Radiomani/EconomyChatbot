Primer on Universal Basic Income
What is Universal Basic Income (UBI)? In general, UBI is a type of cash transfer that is:

             o   Universal: every citizen receives the transfer regardless of employment status or income.
             o   Unconditional: recipients have no restrictions on how they can spend the cash.
             o   Basic: the amount will cover “basic needs” and will constitute a “living wage.”
             o   Long-Term: the cash transfers will last for the long term, e.g. entirety of the receipt’s life.

UBI isn’t an especially new idea; even Thomas Paine was an advocate.i The idea gained traction and elicited
debate in late 1960s (especially during the Nixon administration), but never really gained a foothold.ii

Where is UBI Receiving Policy Interest? Cities in Canada, Finland, the Netherlands, and the US have announced
pilot schemes to test the effects of the policy (generally, these are in very early stages). Governments in
Germany, France, New Zealand, India, Scotland and Namibia have also expressed interest.iii GiveDirectly (a
charity that distributes cash to the poor) has launched a comprehensive study on unconditional cash transfers in
Kenya.iv Most notably, Switzerland held a referendum on UBI in 2016, proposing each citizen receive a monthly
income of about $2700. The proposal was defeated (77% of voters opposed it).v

Who are Prominent Supporters? Prominent supporters include Mark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk and Nobel winning
economist Angus Deaton.vi Warren Buffet supports a related program, the negative income tax, originally
popularized by Milton Friedman.vii

What are the Chief Points of Contention?

Proponents argue that UBI will reduce inequality, direct money to where it is needed most because the person
with the need is the best decision maker, avoid the bad incentives created by traditional welfare programs,
distribute more money because the administrative overhead costs are less, encourage dynamism and risk taking
in the economy, and offer an additional safety net for those who are seeing downward wage pressure from
automation/globalization.

Critics claim that any meaningful basic income scheme will be prohibitively expensive, reduce incentives to work,
redistribute money away from those who need it most to those who already have jobs, and/or redistribute it
away from providing it where it is most needed (e.g. food stamps, social services) to bad or less good usage (e.g.
“they will drink it away”) because of bad choices. (More Detail Below) viii

What Does the Evidence Suggest?

As UBI has never been implemented (unless you count the extremely generous payments Gulf States make to
their citizens), we do not have a true case study to stress test the arguments for and against it. The pilot schemes
that are/will be tried in Canada, the United States, Finland, Scotland, Kenya, and the Netherlands will take years
to report their findings.

We do, however, have the results from numerous experiments looking at the impact of unconditional direct cash
transfers to poor households (i.e. no-strings transfers to cover basic needs for a period, but that weren’t universal
or long term), both in the developed and developing world. These include five experiments in the US and Canada
conducted in the 1970s, as well as over 50 experiments in the developing world.ix Findings from these studies are
regularly employed in debates on UBI.

These studies show an improvement in recipient economic conditions and wellbeing, a modest decrease in
work effort, and a tendency for recipients to spend the transfers productively.x However, the usefulness of
most of these studies is limited by the fact that the transfers ended after a short time period (2-3 years) and
were only awarded to very poor households (not universal) – the studies were structured this way because they
were more focused on testing unconditional cash transfers, rather than something closer to UBI. And the richest
data comes from the developing world, so it is not clear how much can be extrapolated from the behavior of
transfer recipients previously earning less than $1.5 a day with citizens living in more prosperous economies.

To further flesh out what the studiesxii found:

Developed World Studies

    o    Positive effects on economic and general wellbeing. Treated households enjoyed better physical and
         mental health, educational performance, and homeownership rates.
    o    A modest reduction in work effort. Primary earners worked about 5-10% less and were unemployed for
         longer stretches of time. The reduction in working hours was much larger for secondary and tertiary
         earners (15-30%), who devoted more time to child care and education.

Developing World Studies

    o    No decline, or an increase, in hours worked, greater employment participation, and improved
         employment outcomes. In the cases where hours worked declined, the attribution showed the reduction
         to be mainly in the elderly and dependents.
    o    An increase in savings and investment, with recipient households investing a portion of the proceeds in
         income generating goods (livestock, agricultural productive assets etc.). Some studies also found that
         incomes after the transfers had ceased were higher than when they began.
    o    No noticeable increase, and frequently a decline, in consumption towards “temptation goods” (e.g.
         alcohol, tobacco).
    o    A general improvement in health, education, and female empowerment indicators, as well as a notable
         decline in child labor.xiii
                         What would UBI cost if implemented in the US?

                         Below we take a rough cut at estimating how much it would cost to implement UBI in the United States. We first
                         look at what it would cost to pay every American citizen the current poverty threshold ($12,000 a year – an
                         amount less than half what the Swiss proposed implementing in 2016). This would end up costing ~ $3.8 trillion
                         (or 21% of GDP and 78% of all tax revenues and contributions for government social insurance).

                         We next look at how much of this expenditure could be funded through scrapping existing social programs and
                         replacing them with a UBI (as some proponents argue). We first imagine the highly unlikely scenario in which all
                         social spending (excluding infrastructure spending and education, but includes almost all other government
                         transfers to households including healthcare) is scrapped. This would free up about ~ 92% of the funds needed to
                         implement UBI. We subsequently imagine that only income support programs (disability, retirement & social
                         security, welfare, and unemployment benefits) are axed. This would yield ~ 37% of the required funding. Finally,
                         excluding social security, retirement and disability from the list of replaceable programs leaves only 11% of the
                         costs for a UBI of $12,000 covered through replacing existing components of the welfare state.

                         Finally, we imagine two scenarios in which the payouts of UBI are reduced depending on the income level of the
                         receipt. For instance, in the first scenario, every $ of income earned will reduce UBI by 10 cents, meaning that if
                         you make $120,000 you will not receive a basic income, and if you make $60,000 you will receive only half (i.e.
                         $6000). While this is technically not a Universal Basic Income, it may offer a compromise solution between
                         securing the underlying goals of UBI and the constraints/concerns surrounding financing it. As you can see
                         below, this reduces the cost of implementing UBI significantly. However, even using a steep slope, existing
                         income support programs will fall short of fully financing UBI - and additional revenues will likely need to be
                         raised.

                         payments, and food stamps, but excludes general services like infrastructure spending.
As perspective, the chart below shows OECD estimates for how much money would be made available per
person if developed economies replaced all social spending ex-health care with a Universal Basic Income
(purchasing power adjusted). Even the most generous welfare states would struggle to cover the cost of a
poverty-line basic income. Not to say it isn’t possible – just that incremental change in our social/taxation
systems wouldn’t get you there.

More Details on the Pros and Cons for UBI

Other than to provide every citizen in an economy with an income to meet basic needs, and a buffer against
sharp personal financial downturns, supporters argue that UBI will help in:

    o   Reducing Inequality: UBI is seen as a means to reduce inequality, which has risen in developed
        countries. Proponents argue that it will help compensate for 3 decades of low wage growth, increase the
        bargaining power of labor relative to capital, and act as a non-intrusive, and potentially less politically
        toxic, form of redistribution.
    o   Directing Money to Where it is Needed Most: Traditional welfare transfers typically come with
        restrictions as to how the money can be spent (e.g. foods stamps). This means that administrators and
        policy makers end up having to make choices for individuals as to where income support would be most
        impactful in their lives and apply such direction across the board, with limited ability to tailor to
        individual circumstances. In contrast, UBI empowers the individual to decide how best to use the income
        transfer given their particular circumstances and needs.
    o   Minimizing Bad Incentives: UBI offers better incentives than more traditional welfare policies. Unlike
        unemployment benefits or income support, there is no disincentive against seeking better paying
        employment (as UBI will not be cut off as income rises – see appendix 1 for an illustration). Unlike the
        minimum wage, UBI should not make a set of workers prohibitively expensive for employers.
    o   Supporting Economic Dynamism: UBI could support economic dynamism and innovation through
        encouraging people to take more risks, lowering the entry costs for entrepreneurship/accessing
        productivity enhancing skills, and encouraging workers to take the time to seek work better suited to
        their interests, aptitudes, and sense of fulfillment.
    o   Distribute More Money By Reducing Administrative & Overhead Costs: UBI is also seen as a means to
        reduce/replace the large, bureaucratic, and inefficient welfare state with a simpler, more efficient, and
        less politically controversial safety net. This will reduce administrative and overhead costs, meaning that
        more money is actually distributed to those who need it as a percent of the welfare budget.
    o   Protecting against Technological and Economic Disruption: UBI can assure many people a living wage
        as automation, artificial intelligence, and globalization puts downward pressure on wages. UBI would
        also provide greater economic freedom for dislocated workers, allowing them to invest in building new
        skills, rather than having to seek immediate (and likely lower paying) employment. Relatedly…
    o   Combatting the Rise of Anti-Establishment and Populist Politics: The threat of anti-establishment
        politics has led some to advocate for UBI as a means of updating capitalism and sharing its spoils more
        equitably.
    o   Compensating for Unpaid Work: Many socially valuable roles are not formally compensated in a market
        economy (e.g. raising a child) and are predominantly performed by women. UBI is seen as a means to
        begin to recognize, in monetary form, such roles, and rectify resulting imbalances in power, especially in
        the third world.
    o   Providing More Effective International Aid: Currently 700 million people live below the global poverty
        line ($1.9/day). Calculations from the World Bank and Brookings Institute approximate that it would
        take $80 billion in direct cash transfers to lift these individuals above the global poverty line.xiv This is
        almost half of what we currently spend on international aid (OECD’s budget alone is over $130 billion,
        not including private donations).xv

Aside from philosophical arguments opposing redistribution or contesting any inherent right to a fixed income,
opponents argue that UBI will hurt in:

    o   Being Prohibitively Expensive: Opponents argue that implementing any meaningful universal basic
        income will be prohibitively expensive and unsustainable. For instance, the Swiss proposal of awarding
        each citizen about $2700 a month would cost about 25% of GDP.xvi Critics further argue that the tax
        hikes necessary to adequately fund UBI will likely be a significant drag on growth. We go through some
        numbers for the US above.
    o   Reducing Work Ethic: Conservative critics argue that UBI will significantly reduce incentives to work and
        encourage people to work fewer hours and have longer stints in unemployment.
    o   Redistributing Money Away From Those Who Need It Most: Depending on how it’s done, UBI might act
        as a net transfer away from people currently on welfare receipts to those who already have jobs. While
        raising taxes to pay for UBI will likely lead to a net transfer away from the wealthiest, it might
        simultaneously reduce support to those who need it most.
    o   Redistributing Money Away from Providing What is Most Needed to Bad or Less Good Usage:
        Unconditional cash transfers would mean that policy makers cannot try to ensure that the money
        provided is spent towards providing essentials (e.g. food stamps, social spending) versus less impactful
        or even harmful uses (e.g. people spending the transfers on “temptation goods” such as alcohol and
        tobacco).
    o   Distracting From Improving The Existing Welfare State: Some liberal critics have argued that UBI is a
        distraction from the more pressing issue of improving the existing welfare state. Critics are concerned
        that UBI might undermine funding and support for improving tried and tested programs that took
        decades to set up.
Appendix 1: An Illustration of Bad Incentives in Existing Income Support Programs

The chart below shows the effective after tax and transfer income of Americans earning up to 70k. There are
several ‘cliffs’: points at which earning a bit more actually hurts you because you lose eligibility for a social
program.xvii
