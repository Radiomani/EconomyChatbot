The SUTD campusX initiative is set up to create a human-centric cyber-physical learning environment that focuses on the needs and experiences of students and instructors using data analytics and learning sciences.








 Cyber-Physical learning is the digital transformation of higher educational institutions. In our definition, cyber-physical learning is more holistic and broader in nature than blended/hybrid learning and includes additional aspects of the educational ecosystem such as information systems architecture, 5G network, cloud security, technology, pedagogy, learning analytics, learning mode, instructional materials, assessment, student wellness, data privacy and security, etc.
 
At SUTD, we see cyber-physical learning as a form of joint and seamless learning by physical students who are physically present in class and by cyber students who are participating from remote off-campus locations, but who are represented in the physical class via technological means. Cyber-Physical learning also encompasses the learning and teaching interactions among physical students, cyber students, and physical or cyber instructors.
 
SUTD campusX aims to leverage the latest digital learning pedagogies and cutting-edge technology to advance itself as a future-ready university to prepare lifelong tertiary learners and innovators with its campusX initiative. This is achieved through the latest and best-practice pedagogies and technologies such as learning analytics, gamification, robots, artificial intelligence, augmented reality, and virtual reality to provide human and design-centred education experience in the form of personalised, immersive, collaborative, and socially connected learning.

campusX Vision
To pioneer a fun, safe, and inclusive educational experience at SUTD, where lifelong tertiary learners can leverage innovative cyber-physical techno-pedagogies to personalise their learning journeys and achieve optimal learning outcomes.

campusX Philosophy
The central thinking behind campusX is that cyber-physical learning, when powered by educational technology and learning science, is an intimate, interactive, and impactful learning pathway that will drive educational innovations to improve learning outcomes, grow skills and knowledge, and sustain personalised lifelong tertiary learning in a fun, safe, and inclusive way.






SUTD campusX is powered by 'Learning Science' and 'Educational Technology' (the two grey boxes in figure above), together with the interactions between these two enablers. Learning Science involves educational pedagogies, teaching and learning principles and methods, including learning analytics (both real- and post-time); while Educational Technology involves applications, software, and hardware tools that provide seamless and immersive learning experience (such as virtual/augmented reality, gamification, robots, learning analytics, and artificial intelligence). The two enablers ('Learning Science' and 'Educational Technology') interact through various campusX programmes and initiatives (e.g. partnerships, MVPs, research projects), and it is through these interactions that outputs that contribute to the development of campusX are generated.

One such output is knowledge, expertise, and competency to create a campusX pedagogy that is suited to the human and design-centric curriculum of SUTD, termed Technology of Learning (ToL). This unique blend of Technology of Learning (ToL) has three important dimensions: Technology of Cyber-Physical Learning (TOL), Science of Cyber-Physical Learning (SOL), and Ethics of Cyber-Physical Learning (EOL).






One other output generated by the two enablers ('Learning Science' and 'Educational Technology') are the systems, components, and tools that build up campusX. In addition, from consultations with students, instructors, and SUTD leadership team, SUTD campusX has identified three important themes focusing on user experience and learning outcomes: 


Learning Intimacy/Learning Socialisation: How can students (cyber and physical) learn better?  


“Anywhere, Anytime, Anyone” Learning: How can students have various options to learn?  


Safeguarding Governance: How can students learn in a fun, safe, and inclusive environment? 


To achieve these important outcomes, SUTD is conducting various minimum viable products (MVPs) and research and development (R&D) projects, prototyping, and partnership activities to develop appropriate pedagogies and technology tools that can enable SUTD to create a human- and design-centric cyber-physical learning environment, i.e. SUTD campusX.

MESSAGE FROM SUTD CAMPUSX LEAD
WHY SUTD CAMPUSX









"We are working on a new SUTD 'campusX' initiative which looks at how new technologies or existing technologies can be used to enhance the quality of teaching and learning at SUTD and beyond.  This will help us to refine and implement SUTD pedagogy more effectively in the changing learning environment. "
