vDimension
A video streaming server where you upload your lesson videos to securely share them with your students via eDimension. Please contact us at edi_admin@sutd.edu.sg to request for an account.

Please refer to the user guide to find out how you can utilise this tool.
Instructor Guide - Upload Videos vDimension (SUTD Central)Automated Lecture Capture System
The automated lecture capture system allows lectures to be recorded and viewed by students and faculty after the lecture. The recordings can be accessed from eDimension and only students who are enrolled to the course will have access to the recordings.
 
The system automatically records a lecture, uploads it to a server, processes the videos and makes them available for viewing on a streaming server.

The System is installed in LT 2 and LT4 and it captures audio from the main projection and presenter’s microphone along with four video streams.

One tracking camera following the presenter

The system can be used for lectures in courses which support teaching and learning.
 
In order to utilise this system, please make a request to OSA for your lecture to be scheduled in LT2 or LT4. Once you have secured either of these LTs for your lecture, please send us an email at edi_admin@sutd.edu.sg to inform us of your intention to have your lecture recorded. Please include details such as date(s), start and end time, and frequency of your lecture. We will then arrange your lectures to be recorded and made available to your students via eDimension.
PowerPoint Screen Recording User Guide (SUTD Central)



Screen Recording
Large Media Files 



Screen recording can be used for Flipped Learning. You can record a mini lecture on your computer and it can be made available for students ahead of the lesson. It is also possible to create tutorial videos, allowing students to revisit explanations for better understanding.
 
You can record your computer screen/audio and embed it in your PowerPoint slide:

To record and listen to audio associated with your screen recording, you will need a sound card, microphone and speakers.
Make sure there is enough disk space on your local drive to record and save your screen recording.

Please refer to the user guide on screen recording below.


Due to limited storage space in eDimension, we strongly recommend all instructors to upload lecture videos to SUTD’s video streaming server, vDimension.
 
Videos uploaded to vDimension can be linked back seamlessly to eDimension, allowing students to access them easily.
 
To upload videos to vDimension, please send us an email at edi_admin@sutd.edu.sg to request for an account.
