Capital Wars from 1600 to the Present
As I studied past cases of conflict between major powers, I observed that in most cases, before there is a
shooting war, there is a mix of escalating economic, technological, geopolitical, and capital wars. For instance,
while 1939 and 1941 are known as the official starts of World War II in Europe and the Pacific, the conflicts really
began about 10 years before that, with a series of escalating economic and capital conflicts before the “hot war”
began.

To better understand what these economic and capital conflicts could look like in the future, I looked at all the
major cases of capital wars from 1600 to the present. In this study, I lay out the typical nature of these conflicts
and share details on the major cases we looked at.

As we started digging into the different measures that countries have taken, we found that they generally fall into
three categories:
     1) Asset Freezes/Seizures: Preventing an enemy/rival from using or selling foreign assets they own. These
        measures can range from asset freezes for targeted groups in a country (such as current US sanctions on
        the Iranian Revolutionary Guard) up to more extreme measures like unilateral debt repudiation or outright
        seizures of a country’s assets.
     2) Blocking Capital Market Access: Preventing a country from accessing your country’s capital markets,
        either for accessing capital (such as by blocking debt or equity issuance in your country), or for investing
        in your country (such as policies to block inbound investment from rival countries). This can also take the
        form of either withholding ongoing lending or coordinating sales of a country’s assets, with the non-
        economic purpose of weakening them or coercing particular behaviors.
     3) Embargoes/Blockades: Blocking trade in goods or services, either with your own country or in some cases
        with neutral third parties, for the purpose of weakening the targeted country. This can involve blocking
        imports of key supplies (such as occurred with the US embargo of oil to Japan in the lead-up to WWII) or
        blocking exports from the targeted country that represent significant income to that country (such as
        occurred in France’s blockade of the UK in the Napoleonic Wars). 1
All three of these levers can take more and less severe forms, as we show in the following diagram. When looking
at past cases, particularly recent ones, we generally see a range of levers employed at once (such as
simultaneously restricting some trade and engaging in highly targeted asset freezes). And the most severe
levers—such as completely cutting a country off from your financial system or freezing all its assets abroad—
typically comes after a longer period of tit-for-tat escalation (as occurred with the US and Japan in the lead-up
to WWII) or comes in response to a major crisis/provocation from the targeted country (such as the Russian
annexation of Crimea).

The most extreme measures often come when a hot war is imminent or already underway (e.g., the most extreme
measures across the types of levers were all employed in WWII, with a number of measures starting in the lead-
up period). By contrast, US sanctions against Russia over the past decade have involved a range of moderate
measures (broad blockages from the US financial system for key Russian businesses, targeted asset freezes of
specific individuals, and trade restrictions, including ones applied to third-party countries).

 We recognize that embargos may be considered part of trade wars rather than capital wars. However, we learned that embargoes were the
main tool to cut countries off from government/war financing through at least the 19th century (and maybe beyond). The income from naval
trade (and tariffs on that trade) was a big deal for many countries—often easily the single biggest government revenue source. And the big
trading companies had armies bigger than the government’s.

The following table summarizes which of these levers were employed across the historical cases we examined. At
a high level, we see capital wars being used as an instrument of warfare throughout history—there’s evidence of
blockading trade-dependent cities to weaken them as far back as ancient Greece. At the same time, the
composition of levers used has broadly shifted. In earlier conflicts, it generally took the form of
disrupting/blockading trade of an enemy (such as occurred in the Napoleonic Wars or the War of 1812), and so
naval power influenced who could and couldn’t effectively use these weapons. More recently, we’ve seen a wider
array of financial and trade measures used. In particular, over the past half century we’ve seen the US weaponize
its reserve currency status to block its adversaries from the dollar financial system, as well as to threaten neutral
parties that might consider transacting with the US’s adversaries (through what are known as secondary
sanctions). One notable case is the series of financial sanctions against Russia over the past decade, though similar
measures have been employed against Iraq, Iran, Venezuela, and other countries over the past few decades.

* Markets were broadly closed for significant periods of the war.
**Evidence for financial asset seizures and restrictions is limited for pre-20th century conflicts, though many of these conflicts focused upon controlling territories that were
valuable sources of revenue (e.g., colonies, trading posts).
Below, we briefly summarize the major cases.
Major 20th and 21st Century Cases: Portuguese

  •   World War I (1914-18): WWI was preceded by a contest for resource-rich colonies, but given how sudden
      the war was, there were only a couple examples of capital war—with the notable one being Germany
      blocking financial access to Russia in the 1880s. During the war, combatants used an escalating series of
      trade blockades and asset seizures to advance their agendas. All countries banned trading with enemies,
      and naval powers like the UK and the US blockaded Germany, who retaliated by using submarines to
      target merchant ships to the UK. As the war progressed, combatants who initially froze enemy assets
      liquidated them to fund their own war efforts.

  •   World War II (Late 1930s-45): Prior to the war, there was an escalating spiral of capital war and hot war
      conflicts, as Allied powers like the US and the UK placed punitive resource embargoes on Axis countries
      in response to their territorial expansion, which spurred further invasions by Axis powers to support the
      needs of their militaries (such as Japan’s need for oil). As the war began, Allied forces expanded embargoes
      into full blockades, and assets from combatants and neutrals were frozen and then seized. Countries relied
      less on blocking market access or selling assets because target countries were often more reliant on access
      to resources than financial flows at the time.

  •   Cuba Embargo (1960s-Present): Throughout the Cold War, following Castro’s takeover of Cuba, the US
      maintained steady capital war sanctions, including stopping trade with Cuba, freezing financial aid, and
      limiting remittances. Cuba did respond with some seizing of US property in Cuba but lacked the capacity to
      fully retaliate.

  •   The Suez Crisis (1956): After Egypt seized and nationalized the Suez Canal, the UK invaded to regain
      control. The US was opposed to any military intervention, and withheld IMF funds from the UK until British
      forces completely withdrew from Egypt. The UK desperately needed capital as it was hemorrhaging
      reserves and would not be able to maintain convertibility of the pound without US financial support, so the
      UK capitulated and withdrew.

  •   OAPEC Oil Embargo (1970s): From 1973 to 1974, the Arab members of OPEC maintained total oil export
      embargoes against the US and other developed countries for their support of Israel, which Egypt and Syria
      had just invaded. The embargo, as well as massive supply cuts, caused significant economic damage and
      financial asset losses across the world through higher oil prices and inflation. In the end, it did little to affect
      the immediate Arab-Israeli political situation, but it did serve to enrich oil producers and change the US’s
      stance on foreign energy dependence.

  •   US-Iraq Conflicts (1980-2003): The conflict between the US and Iraq lasted for decades and was centered
      around Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait and possible support of terrorism and weapons programs. The US heavily
      enforced severe economic sanctions and the freezing of financial assets over this period to hold leverage
      over Iraq. Through the UN and the US’s allies, the US was also able to exert global pressure, with most of
      the world signing onto the economic sanctions.

  •   Today: The United States currently imposes considerable sanctions on Iran, North Korea, and Russia, along
      with a few other countries. These include asset freezes, bans on US entities trading with or financing
      blacklisted entities, blocking access to dollar-financing pipelines (notably, the SWIFT system), and
      secondary sanctions on neutral entities that trade with blacklisted entities.
Major Cases of Capital War Pre-1900:

  •   Capital War Tactics During the Dutch Empire (1600-1800): The main form of capital war in the wars fought
      by the Dutch during their heyday were trade blockades, cutting off key income sources for their enemies
      from trade and colonial revenues. Several wars broke out over trade barriers and commercial rivalries that
      preceded the war—the most notable examples of this are the First and Second Anglo-Dutch Wars. The
      Fourth Anglo-Dutch war is a key example of the devastating power of capital warfare: by blocking trade
      routes and controlling trading posts, the British managed to bankrupt the Dutch East India Company.

 •    Napoleonic Wars (1803-15): Capital wars were an important lever used by both France and the UK
      throughout the conflict. Three years after the two powers went to war, Britain stepped up a severe blockade
      of naval ports in France. The capital warfare escalated from there in a tit-for-tat manner with cascading
      blockades and trade restrictions (the UK relied on its superior fleet, while France relied on its control of
      many European ports the UK used to trade).

 •    The War of 1812: During the Napoleonic Wars, the US faced capital war pressure from both the British and
      the French as the two sides tried to restrict trade with each other. This along with Britain’s aggressive
      impressment actions (i.e., capturing US citizens and forcing them into the British Navy) caused the US to
      impose trade embargoes against both powers, which hurt the US more than Britain or France. Over 1810 to
      1811 the US ended up reengaging in trade with France while cutting off Britain, eventually leading to war in
      1812. During the war, the British used their superior navy to step up their blockade of US ports.

 •    The US Civil War (1861-65): Over the course of the war, the North blockaded the Confederate states, relying
      on its superior navy, while the South informally cut off exports to Britain and France (“King Cotton
      Diplomacy”) in an unsuccessful attempt to coerce them to join the war effort. Additionally, the North passed
      laws over the course of the war allowing for the seizure of Confederate assets.
