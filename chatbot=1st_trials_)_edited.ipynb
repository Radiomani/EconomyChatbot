With respect to Perón’s nationalizations of foreign investment, it’s worth noting that foreign owners were typically compensated (e.g., his utilities nationalizations were paid for using foreign exchange reserves). Following Perón’s time in power, Argentina continued its long decline in relative prosperity. The subsequent decades saw repeated periods of political instability, military coups, economic mismanagement, and balance of payments crises, each of which would echo the dynamics at play in the time of Perón.\n",

For too many of us life was no longer free; liberty no longer real; men could no longer follow the pursuit of happiness. Against economic tyranny such as this, the American citizen could appeal only to the organized power of government. The collapse of 1929 showed up the despotism for what it was. The election of 1932 was the people's mandate to end it.” (1936) “The hours men and women worked, the wages they received, the conditions of their labor—these had passed beyond the control of the people, and were imposed by this new industrial dictatorship.

            "Because I loved playing the markets I chose to be a global macro investor, which is what Iâve been for about 50 years. That required me to gain a practical understanding of how economies and markets work. Over those years, Iâve had exposure to all sorts of economic systems in most countries and have come to understand why the ability to make money, save it, and put it into capital (i.e., capitalism) is an effective motivator of people and allocator of resources that raises peopleâs living standards. It is an effective motivator of people because it rewards people for their productive activities with money that can be used to get all that money can buy. And it is an effective allocator of resources because the creation of profit requires that the output created is more valuable than the resources that go into creating it. Being productive leads people to make money, which leads them to acquire capital (which is their savings in investment vehicles), which both protects the saver by providing money when it is later needed and provides capital resources to those who can combine them with their ideas and convert them into the profits and productivities that raise our living standards. That is the capitalist system. Over those many years, I have seen communism come and go and have seen that all countries that made their economies work well, including âcommunist China,â have made capitalism an integral part of their systems for these reasons. Communismâs philosophy of âfrom each according to his ability, to each according to his needsâ turned out to be naÃ¯ve because people were not motivated to work hard if they didnât get commensurately rewarded, so prosperity suffered. Capitalism, which connects pay to productivity and creates efficient capital markets that facilitate savings and the availability of buying power to fuel peopleâs productivity, worked much better. Iâve also studied what makes countries succeed and fail by taking a mechanistic perspective rather than an ideological one because my ability to deal with economies and markets in a practical way is what I have been scored on. If youâd like to see a summary of my research that shows what makes countries succeed and fail, itâs here. In a nutshell, poor education, a poor culture (one that impedes people from operating effectively together), poor infrastructure, and too much debt cause bad economic results.\n",

            "When the Federal Reserve (and most other central banks) buys financial assets to put money in the economy in order to stimulate the economy, the sellers of those financial assets (who are rich enough to have financial assets) a) get richer because the financial asset prices rise and b) are more likely to buy financial assets than to buy goods and services, which makes the rich richer and flush with money and credit while the majority of people who are poor donât get money and credit because they are less creditworthy. From being in the investment business, I see that there is a glut of investment money chasing investments at the same time as there is an extreme shortage of money among most people. In other words, money is clogged at the top because if youâre one of those who has money or good ideas of how to make money you can have more money than you need because lenders will freely lend it to you and investors will compete to give it to you. On the other hand, if youâre not in financially good shape nobody will lend to you or invest in you and the government doesnât help materially because the government doesnât do that. Policy makers pay too much attention to budgets relative to returns on investments. For example, not spending money on educating our children well might be good from a budget perspective, but itâs really stupid from an investment perspective. Looking at the funding through a budget lens doesnât lead one to take into consideration the all-in economic pictureâe.g., it doesnât take into consideration the all-in costs to the society of having poorly educated people. While focusing on the budget is what fiscal conservatives typically do, fiscal liberals have typically shown themselves to borrow too much money and fail to spend it wisely to produce the economic returns that are required to service the debts they have taken on, so they often end up with debt crises. The budget hawk conservatives and the pro-spending/borrowing liberals have trouble focusing on, working together for, and achieving good âdouble bottom lineâ return on investments (i.e., investments that produce both good social returns and good economic returns). What I Think Should Be Done For the previously explained reasons, I believe that capitalism is a fundamentally sound system that is now not working well for the majority of people, so it must be reformed to provide many more equal opportunities and to be more productive.\n",

            "As you can see, they are each more extreme and they are more divided than ever before. The chart on the right shows what percentage of them have voted along party lines going back to 1790, which is now the greatest ever. In other words, they have more polar extreme positions and they are more solidified in those positions than ever. And we are coming into a presidential election year. We can expect a hell of a battle. It doesnât take a genius to know that when a system is producing outcomes that are so inconsistent with its goals, it needs to be reformed. In the next part, I will explore why it is producing these substandard outcomes and what I think should be done to reform it. Part 2 My Diagnosis of Why Capitalism Is Now Not Working Well for the Majority of People I believe that reality works like a machine with cause/effect relationships that produce outcomes, and that when the outcomes fall short of the goals one needs to diagnose why the machine is working inadequately and then reform it. I also believe that most everything happens over and over again through history, and by observing and thinking through these patterns one can better understand how reality works and acquire timeless and universal principles for dealing with it better. I believe that the previously shown outcomes are unacceptable, so that we first need to look at how the economic machine is producing these outcomes and then think about how to reform it. Contrary to what populists of the left and populists of the right are saying, these unacceptable outcomes arenât due to either a) evil rich people doing bad things to poor people or b) lazy poor people and bureaucratic inefficiencies, as much as they are due to how the capitalist system is now working. I believe that all good things taken to an extreme become self-destructive and everything must evolve or die, and that these principles now apply to capitalism. While the pursuit of profit is usually an effective motivator and resource allocator for creating productivity and for providing those who are productive with buying power, it is now producing a self-reinforcing feedback loop that widens the income/wealth/opportunity gap to the point that capitalism and the American Dream are in jeopardy. That is because capitalism is now working in a way in which people and companies find it profitable to have policies and make technologies that lessen their people costs, which lessens a large percentage of the populationâs share of societyâs resources.\n",

Economic Principles - Why and How Capitalism Needs To Be Reformed   Economic Principles  Facebook  Twitter  LinkedIn  Instagram   Why and How Capitalism Needs To Be Reformed Ray Dalio April 5th, 2019  Summary I was fortunate enough to be raised in a middle-class family by parents who took good care of me, to go to good public schools, and to come into a job market that offered me equal opportunity. I was raised with the belief that having equal opportunity to have basic care, good education, and employment is what is fair and best for our collective well-being. To have these things and use them to build a great life is what was meant by living the American Dream. At age 12 one might say that I became a capitalist because thatâs when I took the money I earned doing various jobs, like delivering newspapers, mowing lawns, and caddying and put it in the stock market when the stock market was hot. That got me hooked on the economic investing game which Iâve played for most of the last 50 years. To succeed at this game I needed to gain a practical understanding of how economies and markets work. My exposure to most economic systems in most countries over many years taught me that the ability to make money, save it, and put it into capital (i.e., capitalism) is the most effective motivator of people and allocator of resources to raise peopleâs living standards. Over these many years I have also seen capitalism evolve in a way that it is not working well for the majority of Americans because itâs producing self-reinforcing spirals up for the haves and down for the have-nots. This is creating widening income/wealth/opportunity gaps that pose existential threats to the United States because these gaps are bringing about damaging domestic and international conflicts and weakening Americaâs condition. I think that most capitalists donât know how to divide the economic pie well and most socialists donât know how to grow it well, yet we are now at a juncture in which either a) people of different ideological inclinations will work together to skillfully re-engineer the system so that the pie is both divided and grown well or b) we will have great conflict and some form of revolution that will hurt most everyone and will shrink the pie.\n",

            "Such decisions would of course be up to the people on the bipartisan commission and the leadership to decide and are way too complicated an engineering exercise for me to opine on here. I can, however, give my big picture inclinations. Above all else, Iâd want to achieve good double bottom line results. To do that Iâd: Create private-public partnerships (including governments, philanthropists, and companies) that would jointly vet and invest in double bottom line projects that would be judged on the basis of their social and economic performance results relative to clear metrics. That would both increase the funding for and the quality of projects because people who have to put their own money on the line would be responsible for them. (For examples, see the Appendix.) Raise money in ways that both improve conditions and improve the economyâs productivity by taking into consideration the all-in costs for the society (e.g., Iâd tax pollution and various causes of bad health that have sizable economic costs for the society). Raise more from the top via taxes that would be engineered to not have disruptive effects on productivity and that would be earmarked to help those in the middle and the bottom primarily in ways that also improve the economyâs overall level of productivity, so that the spending on these programs is largely paid for by the cost savings and income improvements that they create. Having said that, I also believe that the society has to establish minimum standards of healthcare and education that are provided to those who are unable to take care of themselves. Coordination of monetary and fiscal policies. Because money is clogged at the top and because the capacity of central banks to ease enough to reverse the next economic downturn is limited, fiscal policy will have to be more coordinated with monetary policy, which can happen while maintaining the Federal Reserveâs independence. If done well, this will both stimulate economic growth and reduce the effects that quantitative easing has on increasing the wealth gap by shifting money and credit into the hands of those who have a higher propensity to spend from those who have a higher propensity to save and from those who need it less to those who need it more. Looking Ahead In assessing the position we are in, we can look at both cause/effect relationships and historical comparisons.\n",

            "When the Federal Reserve (and most other central banks) buys financial assets to put money in the economy in order to stimulate the economy, the sellers of those financial assets (who are rich enough to have financial assets) a) get richer because the financial asset prices rise and b) are more likely to buy financial assets than to buy goods and services, which makes the rich richer and flush with money and credit while the majority of people who are poor donât get money and credit because they are less creditworthy. From being in the investment business, I see that there is a glut of investment money chasing investments at the same time as there is an extreme shortage of money among most people. In other words, money is clogged at the top because if youâre one of those who has money or good ideas of how to make money you can have more money than you need because lenders will freely lend it to you and investors will compete to give it to you. On the other hand, if youâre not in financially good shape nobody will lend to you or invest in you and the government doesnât help materially because the government doesnât do that. Policy makers pay too much attention to budgets relative to returns on investments. For example, not spending money on educating our children well might be good from a budget perspective, but itâs really stupid from an investment perspective. Looking at the funding through a budget lens doesnât lead one to take into consideration the all-in economic pictureâe.g., it doesnât take into consideration the all-in costs to the society of having poorly educated people. While focusing on the budget is what fiscal conservatives typically do, fiscal liberals have typically shown themselves to borrow too much money and fail to spend it wisely to produce the economic returns that are required to service the debts they have taken on, so they often end up with debt crises. The budget hawk conservatives and the pro-spending/borrowing liberals have trouble focusing on, working together for, and achieving good âdouble bottom lineâ return on investments (i.e., investments that produce both good social returns and good economic returns). What I Think Should Be Done For the previously explained reasons, I believe that capitalism is a fundamentally sound system that is now not working well for the majority of people, so it must be reformed to provide many more equal opportunities and to be more productive.\n",

            "That is because they don’t provide adequate income. In fact, most of them won’t provide any income, so they are worthless for that purpose. They just provide a “safe” place to store principal. As a result, to finance their expenditures, owners of them will have to sell off principal, which will diminish the amount of principal that they have left, so that they a) will need progressively higher and higher returns on the dwindling amounts (which they have no prospect of getting) or b) they will have to accelerate their eating away at principal until the money runs out. That will happen at the same time that there will be greater internal conflicts (mostly between socialists and capitalists) about how to divide the pie and greater external conflicts (mostly between countries about how to divide both the global economic pie and global influence). In such a world, storing one’s money in cash and bonds will no longer be safe. Bonds are a claim on money and governments are likely to continue printing money to pay their debts with devalued money. That’s the easiest and least controversial way to reduce the debt burdens and without raising taxes. My guess is that bonds will provide bad real and nominal returns for those who hold them, but not lead to significant price declines and higher interest rates because I think that it is most likely that central banks will buy more of them to hold interest rates down and keep prices up. In other words, I suspect that the new paradigm will be characterized by large debt monetizations that will be most similar to those that occurred in the 1940s war years. So, the big question worth pondering at this time is which investments will perform well in a reflationary environment accompanied by large liabilities coming due and with significant internal conflict between capitalists and socialists, as well as external conflicts. It is also a good time to ask what will be the next-best currency or 12 \fstorehold of wealth to have when most reserve currency central bankers want to devalue their currencies in a fiat currency system. Most people now believe the best “risky investments” will continue to be equity and equity-like investments, such as leveraged private equity, leveraged real estate, and venture capital, and this is especially true when central banks are reflating.\n",

            "Such decisions would of course be up to the people on the bipartisan commission and the leadership to decide and are way too complicated an engineering exercise for me to opine on here. I can, however, give my big picture inclinations. Above all else, Iâd want to achieve good double bottom line results. To do that Iâd: Create private-public partnerships (including governments, philanthropists, and companies) that would jointly vet and invest in double bottom line projects that would be judged on the basis of their social and economic performance results relative to clear metrics. That would both increase the funding for and the quality of projects because people who have to put their own money on the line would be responsible for them. (For examples, see the Appendix.) Raise money in ways that both improve conditions and improve the economyâs productivity by taking into consideration the all-in costs for the society (e.g., Iâd tax pollution and various causes of bad health that have sizable economic costs for the society). Raise more from the top via taxes that would be engineered to not have disruptive effects on productivity and that would be earmarked to help those in the middle and the bottom primarily in ways that also improve the economyâs overall level of productivity, so that the spending on these programs is largely paid for by the cost savings and income improvements that they create. Having said that, I also believe that the society has to establish minimum standards of healthcare and education that are provided to those who are unable to take care of themselves. Coordination of monetary and fiscal policies. Because money is clogged at the top and because the capacity of central banks to ease enough to reverse the next economic downturn is limited, fiscal policy will have to be more coordinated with monetary policy, which can happen while maintaining the Federal Reserveâs independence. If done well, this will both stimulate economic growth and reduce the effects that quantitative easing has on increasing the wealth gap by shifting money and credit into the hands of those who have a higher propensity to spend from those who have a higher propensity to save and from those who need it less to those who need it more. Looking Ahead In assessing the position we are in, we can look at both cause/effect relationships and historical comparisons.\n",

            "Those companies and people who are richer have greater buying power, which motivates those who seek profit to shift their resources to produce what the haves want relative to what the have-nots want, which includes fundamentally required things like good care and education for the have-not children. We just saw this exemplified in the college admissions cheating scandal. As a result of this dynamic, the system is producing self-reinforcing spirals up for the haves and down for the have-nots, which are leading to harmful excesses at the top and harmful deprivations at the bottom. More specifically, I believe that: The pursuit of profit and greater efficiencies has led to the invention of new technologies that replace people, which has made companies run more efficiently, rewarded those who invented these technologies, and hurt those who were replaced by them. This force will accelerate over the next several years, and there is no plan to deal with it well. The pursuit of greater profits and greater company efficiencies has also led companies to produce in other countries and to replace American workers with cost-effective foreign workers, which was good for these companiesâ profits and efficiencies but bad for the American workersâ incomes. Of course, this globalization also allowed less expensive and perhaps better quality foreign goods to come into the US, which has been good for both the foreign sellers and the American buyers of them and bad for the American companies and workers who compete with them. Because of these two forces, the share of revenue that has gone to profits has increased relative to the share that has gone to the worker. The charts below show the percentage of corporate revenue that has gone to profits and the percentage that has gone to employee compensation since 1929. Central banksâ printing of money and buying of financial assets (which were necessary to deal with the 2008 debt crisis and to stimulate economic growth) drove up the prices of financial assets, which helped make people who own financial assets richer relative to those who donât own them.\n",

            "Thatâs for the population as a whole. For most of those in the lower 60%, the prospects are worse. As shown below, the income gap is about as high as ever and the wealth gap is the highest since the late 1930s. Today, the wealth of the top 1% of the population is more than that of the bottom 90% of the population combined, which is the same sort of wealth gap that existed during the 1935-40 period (a period that brought in an era of great internal and external conflicts for most countries). Those in the top 40% now have on average more than 10 times as much wealth as those in the bottom 60%.iv That is up from six times in 1980. The following charts show real income growth by quintiles for the overall population since 1970. Ask yourself which one youâre in. That probably has given you your perspective. My objective is to show you the broader perspective. Real Mean Household Income by Quintile (2017 USD) Most people in the bottom 60% are poor. For example, only about a third of the bottom 60% save any of their income in cash or financial assets. According to a recent Federal Reserve study, 40% of all Americans would struggle to raise $400 in the event of an emergency.viii And they are increasingly getting stuck being poor. The following chart shows the odds of someone in the bottom quintile moving up to the middle quintile or higher in a 10-year period. Those odds declined from about 23% in 1990 to only 14% as of 2011. While most Americans think of the US as being a country of great economic mobility and opportunity, its economic mobility rate is now one of the worst in the developed world. As shown below, in the US people whose fathers were in the bottom income quartile have a 40% chance of staying in that quartile and only about an 8% chance of making it to the top quartile, which is half of the average probability of moving up and one of the worst probabilities of the countries analyzed. In a country of equal opportunity, that would not exist. Est Percentage of People Born to Bottom-Quartile Fathers In Top vs Bottom Quartiles Oneâs income growth results from oneâs productivity growth, which results from oneâs personal development.\n",

There has been a wave of stock buybacks, mergers, acquisitions, and private equity and venture capital investing that has been funded by both cheap money and credit and the enormous amount of cash that was pushed into the system. That pushed up equities and other asset prices and drove down future returns. It has also made cash nearly worthless. (I will explain more about why that is and why it is unsustainable in a moment.) The gains in investment asset prices benefited those who have investment assets much more than those who don’t, which increased the wealth gap, which is creating political anti-capitalist sentiment and increasing pressure to shift more of the money printing into the hands of those who are not investors/capitalists. 3. Profit margins grew rapidly due to advances in automation and globalization that reduced the costs of labor. The chart below on the left shows that growth. It is unlikely that this rate of profit margin growth will be sustained, and there is a good possibility that margins will shrink in the environment ahead.

            "By looking at who has what assets and liabilities, asking yourself who the central bank needs to help most, and figuring out what they are 7 \fmost likely to do given the tools they have at their disposal, you can get at the most likely monetary policy shifts, which are the main drivers of paradigm shifts. To me, it seems obvious that they have to help the debtors relative to the creditors. At the same time, it appears to me that the forces of easing behind this paradigm (i.e., interest rate cuts and quantitative easing) will have diminishing effects. For these reasons, I believe that monetizations of debt and currency depreciations will eventually pick up, which will reduce the value of money and real returns for creditors and test how far creditors will let central banks go in providing negative real returns before moving into other assets. To be clear, I am not saying that this shift will happen immediately. I am saying that I think it is approaching and will have a big effect on what the next paradigm will look like. The chart below shows interest rate and QE changes in the US going back to 1920 so you can see the two times that happened—in 1931-45 and in 2008-14.

As you can see, when interest rates hit 0%, the money printing began in all of these economies. The ECB ended its QE program at the end of 2018, while the BoJ is still increasing the money supply. Now, all three central banks are turning to these forms of easing again, as growth is slowing and inflation remains below target levels.\n",

I think these are unlikely to be good real returning investments and that those that will most likely do best will be those that do well when the value of money is being depreciated and domestic and international conflicts are significant, such as gold. Additionally, for reasons I will explain in the near future, most investors are underweighted in such assets, meaning that if they just wanted to have a better balanced portfolio to reduce risk, they would have more of this sort of asset. For this reason, I believe that it would be both risk-reducing and return-enhancing to consider adding gold to one’s portfolio. I will soon send out an explanation of why I believe that gold is an effective portfolio diversifier. Appendix to Part I: Looking at Historical Paradigm Shifts More Closely This appendix includes charts of US economic and market movements along with a bit more comprehensive description of what went on in those decades. It is for people who want to delve deeper into what happened in those decades. The 1920s: “Roaring”—From Boom to Bursting Bubble The 1920s started off economically depressed, with stock prices reflecting pessimism as a hangover from World War I and weak economic conditions that were induced by tightening from the Fed. When the war ended in November 1918, the Federal Reserve let money and credit grow at fast rates and inflation soar. Money was backed by gold then, so gold reserves started to decline. So the Fed was faced with the choice of tightening or devaluing. In early 1920, the Fed chose tightening and raised interest rates from 1.25% to 6%. As a result, the economy plunged. So the decade started off with the economy in a severe contraction and stock prices discounting a bad economy. The biggest imbalance that existed at the beginning of the decade resulted from the Treaty of Versailles: the balance of payments it produced caused turbulence early in the decade, especially in Europe. Naturally, as a result of the war and the economy being in a deep contraction, investors priced stocks for negative growth with a high risk premium.\n",

            "Because I loved playing the markets I chose to be a global macro investor, which is what Iâve been for about 50 years. That required me to gain a practical understanding of how economies and markets work. Over those years, Iâve had exposure to all sorts of economic systems in most countries and have come to understand why the ability to make money, save it, and put it into capital (i.e., capitalism) is an effective motivator of people and allocator of resources that raises peopleâs living standards. It is an effective motivator of people because it rewards people for their productive activities with money that can be used to get all that money can buy. And it is an effective allocator of resources because the creation of profit requires that the output created is more valuable than the resources that go into creating it. Being productive leads people to make money, which leads them to acquire capital (which is their savings in investment vehicles), which both protects the saver by providing money when it is later needed and provides capital resources to those who can combine them with their ideas and convert them into the profits and productivities that raise our living standards. That is the capitalist system. Over those many years, I have seen communism come and go and have seen that all countries that made their economies work well, including âcommunist China,â have made capitalism an integral part of their systems for these reasons. Communismâs philosophy of âfrom each according to his ability, to each according to his needsâ turned out to be naÃ¯ve because people were not motivated to work hard if they didnât get commensurately rewarded, so prosperity suffered. Capitalism, which connects pay to productivity and creates efficient capital markets that facilitate savings and the availability of buying power to fuel peopleâs productivity, worked much better. Iâve also studied what makes countries succeed and fail by taking a mechanistic perspective rather than an ideological one because my ability to deal with economies and markets in a practical way is what I have been scored on. If youâd like to see a summary of my research that shows what makes countries succeed and fail, itâs here.

I will be paying close attention to all this and will keep you informed. Appendix: My Perspective On Double Bottom Line Investing I felt that I should give some examples of good double bottom line investing so thatâs what this appendix is about. From doing my philanthropic work, I see great double bottom line investments all the time, and I only see a small percentage of them so I know that there are vastly more. Since my wife and I focus especially in education and microfinance, my window is more in these areas than elsewhere though we have been exposed to many in other areas such as healthcare, the reform of the criminal justice system, environmental protection, etc. For example, a few of the good double bottom line investments that I came across are: Early childhood education programs that produce returns of about 10-15% annualized in the form of cost savings for the government when one accounts for the lifetime benefits for the students and society. That is because they lead to better school performance, higher earnings, and lower odds of committing crimes, all of which have direct economic benefits for society.liii Relatively inexpensive interventions that lead to lower high school dropout rates in grades 8 and 9 can pay for themselves many times over. Moving these young students into practical higher education or trade jobs when done well is highly cost-effective. For example, the lifetime earnings of a college graduate are over $1 million higher than those of a high school dropout.liv School finance reforms show that a 10% increase in per-pupil spending can have a meaningful impact on educational outcomes for low-income students, producing a higher ROI than spending on higher-income students. Overall, researchers have found that additional school spending has an IRR of roughly 10%.lv Microfinance. For every dollar donated/invested in this, approximately $12 is lent, paid back, and lent again over the next 10 years to disadvantaged people to start and build their businesses.lvi Numerous infrastructure spending plans that can facilitate trade and improve productivity/efficiency.\n",

            "Those companies and people who are richer have greater buying power, which motivates those who seek profit to shift their resources to produce what the haves want relative to what the have-nots want, which includes fundamentally required things like good care and education for the have-not children. We just saw this exemplified in the college admissions cheating scandal. As a result of this dynamic, the system is producing self-reinforcing spirals up for the haves and down for the have-nots, which are leading to harmful excesses at the top and harmful deprivations at the bottom. More specifically, I believe that: The pursuit of profit and greater efficiencies has led to the invention of new technologies that replace people, which has made companies run more efficiently, rewarded those who invented these technologies, and hurt those who were replaced by them. This force will accelerate over the next several years, and there is no plan to deal with it well. The pursuit of greater profits and greater company efficiencies has also led companies to produce in other countries and to replace American workers with cost-effective foreign workers, which was good for these companiesâ profits and efficiencies but bad for the American workersâ incomes. Of course, this globalization also allowed less expensive and perhaps better quality foreign goods to come into the US, which has been good for both the foreign sellers and the American buyers of them and bad for the American companies and workers who compete with them. Because of these two forces, the share of revenue that has gone to profits has increased relative to the share that has gone to the worker. The charts below show the percentage of corporate revenue that has gone to profits and the percentage that has gone to employee compensation since 1929. Central banksâ printing of money and buying of financial assets (which were necessary to deal with the 2008 debt crisis and to stimulate economic growth) drove up the prices of financial assets, which helped make people who own financial assets richer relative to those who donât own them.\n",

            "That is because they don’t provide adequate income. In fact, most of them won’t provide any income, so they are worthless for that purpose. They just provide a “safe” place to store principal. As a result, to finance their expenditures, owners of them will have to sell off principal, which will diminish the amount of principal that they have left, so that they a) will need progressively higher and higher returns on the dwindling amounts (which they have no prospect of getting) or b) they will have to accelerate their eating away at principal until the money runs out. That will happen at the same time that there will be greater internal conflicts (mostly between socialists and capitalists) about how to divide the pie and greater external conflicts (mostly between countries about how to divide both the global economic pie and global influence). In such a world, storing one’s money in cash and bonds will no longer be safe. Bonds are a claim on money and governments are likely to continue printing money to pay their debts with devalued money. That’s the easiest and least controversial way to reduce the debt burdens and without raising taxes. My guess is that bonds will provide bad real and nominal returns for those who hold them, but not lead to significant price declines and higher interest rates because I think that it is most likely that central banks will buy more of them to hold interest rates down and keep prices up. In other words, I suspect that the new paradigm will be characterized by large debt monetizations that will be most similar to those that occurred in the 1940s war years. So, the big question worth pondering at this time is which investments will perform well in a reflationary environment accompanied by large liabilities coming due and with significant internal conflict between capitalists and socialists, as well as external conflicts. It is also a good time to ask what will be the next-best currency or 12 \fstorehold of wealth to have when most reserve currency central bankers want to devalue their currencies in a fiat currency system. Most people now believe the best “risky investments” will continue to be equity and equity-like investments, such as leveraged private equity, leveraged real estate, and venture capital, and this is especially true when central banks are reflating.\n",

The previously described income/wealth/opportunity gap and its manifestations pose existential threats to the US because these conditions weaken the US economically, threaten to bring about painful and counterproductive domestic conflict, and undermine the United Statesâ strength relative to that of its global competitors. These gaps weaken us economically because: They slow our economic growth because the marginal propensity to spend of wealthy people is much less than the marginal propensity to spend of people who are short of money. They result in suboptimal talent development and lead to a large percentage of the population undertaking damaging activities rather than contributing activities. In addition to social and economic bad consequences, the income/wealth/opportunity gap is leading to dangerous social and political divisions that threaten our cohesive fabric and capitalism itself.

            "For a detailed account of this period, see pages 49-95 in Part Two of Principles for Navigating Big Debt Crises. 1940s = War and Post-War. The economy and markets were classically war-driven. Governments around the world both borrowed heavily and printed significant amounts of money, stimulating both private-sector employment in support of the war effort and military employment. While production was strong, much of what was produced was used and destroyed in the war, so classic measures of growth and unemployment are misleading. Still, this war-effort production pulled the US out of the post-Great Depression slump. Monetary policy was kept very easy to accommodate the borrowing and the paying back of debts in the post-war period. Specifically, monetary policy remained stimulative, with interest rates held down and fiscal policy liberally producing large budget deficits during the war and then after the war to promote reconstruction abroad (the Marshall Plan). As a result, stocks, bonds, and commodities all rallied over the period, with commodities rallying the most early in the war, and stocks rallying the most later in the war (when an Allied victory looked to be more likely) and then at the conclusion of the war. The pictures of what happened in other countries, especially those that lost the war, were radically different and are worthy of description at another time. After the war, the United States was the preeminent power and the dollar was the world’s reserve currency linked to gold, with other currencies linked to the dollar. This period is an excellent period for exemplifying 1) the power and mechanics of central banks to hold interest rates down with large fiscal deficits and 2) market action during war periods. 1950s = Post-War Recovery. In the 1950s, after two decades of depression and war, most individuals were financially conservative, favoring security over risk-taking. The markets reflected this by de facto pricing in negative levels of earnings growth with very high risk premia (e.g., S&P 500 dividend yields in 1950 were 6.8%, more than 3 times the 10-year bond yield of 1.9%, and earning yields were nearly 14%). What happened in the ‘50s was exactly the opposite of what was discounted. The post-war recovery was strong (averaging 4% real growth over the decade), in part through continued stimulative policy/low rates. As a result, stocks did great.\n",

Spain, the Spanish Civil War, and Rise of Franco Spain’s story—like those of Italy, Germany, and Japan—is one in which a democratically led government was unable to maintain order in the midst of a conflict between populists of the left and populists of the right. In this case, the conflict was so severe that a civil war began in 1936 during the democracy of the Second Republic between right-wing Nationalists and left-wing Republicans. This is one of those classic cases in which the military took control. Franco was the top general of the Nationalists and assumed power in 1939 when the Nationalists took Madrid.

            "As inflation accelerated and the economy weakened in 1969-70, the Fed could not afford to maintain a tight monetary policy, so the balance of payments worsened and the dollar nosedived. Rather than running surpluses, the US ran unsustainably huge balance of payments deficits. While we weren’t noticing, other industrialized countries fully regained their economic strength, becoming very competitive in the world markets. In the summer of 1971, Americans traveling in Europe had difficulty exchanging their dollars for German marks, French francs, and British pounds. The administration vowed not to “devalue” the dollar, but in August of 1971, President Richard Nixon “floated” the dollar. The US defaulted on its commitments to pay in gold, offering paper money instead. Money and credit growth were no longer constrained, and the decade of stagflation had begun. Like a great stag noticing his first twinge of maturity, rather than seeing these problems as signs of things to come, Americans viewed them as nothing more than a temporary setback rather than a more significant turning point. Yet as the decade progressed, economic problems contributed to political problems and vice versa. As the Vietnam War and the Watergate affair dragged on, they both weighed on the American psyche, so Americans were not in the mood to cut their living standards in response to OPEC-induced oil price increases and droughtinduced food price hikes. Instead, as costs rose, Americans borrowed more in order to maintain their lifestyles, and the Fed allowed accelerated money supply growth in order to accommodate these high borrowings and to prevent unacceptably high interest rates. Since Americans saw their incomes rise while inflation was rising faster, inflation was blamed for slipping living standards. The fact is that if the Fed had restrained money supply growth and inflation had not accelerated, we still would have experienced a lower standard of living. As Americans printed money and created credit to service large debts while other industrialized and OPEC countries became richer, our living standards had to erode. Price and wage controls were tried early in the decade, which created such great inefficiencies that they were quickly abandoned. So the “twin deficits” continued and were accommodated by money and credit creation. The dollars that these deficits produced went to surplus countries, which deposited them with American banks, which lent them to Latin American and other emerging, commodity-producing countries.\n",

            "As a result, while in the 1970s, countries with dollar surpluses recycled their dollars via American financial market intermediaries which lent recklessly to new borrowers in places like Latin America, in the 2000s, countries with dollar surpluses (especially 39 \fChina) recycled their dollars via American financial market intermediaries to reckless borrowers in the US. Because of this lending, and because the Fed remained easy (because inflation rates remained low), debt growth and consumption growth rates remained much higher than income growth rates and the prices of financial assets soared. This created an illusion of prosperity. When cash flows fell short of debt service requirements and volatility picked up, the second bubble of the decade burst. In 2008, the debt and economic crises led the Fed (and other central banks) to ease until interest rates hit 0%, at which point the Fed “printed” more money faster, and spent it buying a broader range of financial assets, than it ever had before. As a result, at the end of the decade, the stock market, gold, and commodity prices immediately recovered strongly, and the dollar plunged. Also in 2008, as in 1932, the old, right-of-center administration was voted out of office and a new left-of-center administration entered office, large government spending programs were initiated, and large budget deficits resulted. For the decade as a whole, gold and commodities rose at annualized rates of 15% and 12%, respectively, long-duration bonds of similar volatility to stocks returned 10%, and stocks were flat. Real growth averaged 1.8%, the lowest of any decade examined. Disinflationary pressures from economic weakness and emerging markets’ capacity coming online led to inflation falling to 2.5%, despite rapidly rising commodity prices. The following charts show the main market and economic dynamics over these 10 years.\n",

            "Bolstered by a decade of prosperity, in the ’60s Americans lost their cautiousness and kept their confidence. Since the world was our oyster, conquering outer space was our next logical goal. In an America of strength and wealth, just about everyone agreed that poverty should be eliminated. Americans never thought about how much a space program, the war on poverty, and the Vietnam War would cost, because they felt so rich they naturally assumed they could afford these things. Also in the 1960s, countries that were impaired in the war and were rebuilding in the 1950s emerged as important competitors. As a result, a balance of payments problem began to build for the United States. The government found spending easier than taxing, so it became a heavy borrower. While the government’s debts grew fast, private debts grew even faster. While in the “old fashioned” 1950s, Americans settled for more modest aspirations in order to save, Americans in the “modern” 1960s became more familiar with how credit could raise their living standards. The more we borrowed and bought, the more people were employed, the stronger the economy became, and hence the more we could afford to borrow and buy. It was the miracle of Keynesian economics. In the ’60s, Americans really believed that the economy could be turned into a sort of perpetual wealth machine. During the first half of this decade, the Federal Reserve didn’t want to put a damper on this party, so when the demand for money increased, the Fed increased the supply and allowed strong credit creation, which worsened the balance of payments problem. The government’s budget deficits increased as the costs of Vietnam were added to the costs of space and poverty programs. The increased supply of money stimulated inflation, which made it that much more desirable to borrow and buy. I remember trading stocks as a kid then; as I have been trading stocks ever since, I can say with confidence that the stock market bubble in the mid-1960s was more pervasive than at any other time since. At the time, the most popular theory about the economy and investing was that economic management had become more of a science, so that though there would be minor swings, we could count on relatively stable growth, 26 \fso “dollar-cost averaging” in the stock market was the way to invest.\n",

            "Those companies and people who are richer have greater buying power, which motivates those who seek profit to shift their resources to produce what the haves want relative to what the have-nots want, which includes fundamentally required things like good care and education for the have-not children. We just saw this exemplified in the college admissions cheating scandal. As a result of this dynamic, the system is producing self-reinforcing spirals up for the haves and down for the have-nots, which are leading to harmful excesses at the top and harmful deprivations at the bottom. More specifically, I believe that: The pursuit of profit and greater efficiencies has led to the invention of new technologies that replace people, which has made companies run more efficiently, rewarded those who invented these technologies, and hurt those who were replaced by them. This force will accelerate over the next several years, and there is no plan to deal with it well. The pursuit of greater profits and greater company efficiencies has also led companies to produce in other countries and to replace American workers with cost-effective foreign workers, which was good for these companiesâ profits and efficiencies but bad for the American workersâ incomes. Of course, this globalization also allowed less expensive and perhaps better quality foreign goods to come into the US, which has been good for both the foreign sellers and the American buyers of them and bad for the American companies and workers who compete with them. Because of these two forces, the share of revenue that has gone to profits has increased relative to the share that has gone to the worker. The charts below show the percentage of corporate revenue that has gone to profits and the percentage that has gone to employee compensation since 1929. Central banksâ printing of money and buying of financial assets (which were necessary to deal with the 2008 debt crisis and to stimulate economic growth) drove up the prices of financial assets, which helped make people who own financial assets richer relative to those who donât own them.\n",
